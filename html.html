			<h1 class="text-center page-title">Tour of Web Fundamentals &mdash; HTML</h1>
			<h3 class="text-center">Good to Know</h3>
			<p>
				<abbr title="Hyper-Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, Hyper-Text 
				Markup Language, is the foundation of any web page. Any language
				is an agreed upon standard of symbols in a set format to convey meaning.
				The <a href="https://www.w3.org">World Wide Web Consortium </a> maintains 
				the standards for HTML, CSS, and other web communication technologies.
				In short, HTML is a standardized way of defining the contents of a web page.
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-center">Get Ready</h3>
			<p>
				There are only two things we need before starting: a text editor to create
				a web page and a web browser to view it. A good free text editor is Notepad++. 
				A popular browser is Google Chrome. I will be using both of these tools for 
				our tour, but feel free to use your own favorite tools. 
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Notepad++:</em> You can download the proper version for your device at the 
				<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/">Download page</a>. 
				Just run the setup program accepting all the defaults.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>Chrome:</em> Click "Download Chrome"on the 
				<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgbecvN7b5AIV0MDACh0DpAQWEAAYASABEgJT6PD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">
				Download page</a> to automatically download and install.
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-center">Let's Get Going</h3>
			<p>
				HTML is a way of marking up a page in a way which the browser can understand. The 
				markup consists of tags denoted by left and right arrows around defined words. Tags
				generally come in pairs; a start tag and an end tag. Code 1 shows the minimal
				markup to form a web page.
			</p>
			<figure class="figure">
				<pre class="border border-primary rounded-lg"><code>
	&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
	&lt;html&gt;
		&lt;head&gt;
			&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
			&lt;title&gt;Web Page Minimum&lt;/title&gt;		
		&lt;/head&gt;
		&lt;body&gt;	
		&lt;/body&gt;
	&lt;/html&gt;
				</code></pre>
			<figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">Code 1: Minimal code for a web page.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				So, what is happening here? And, didn't I say the tags come in pairs? What is the 
				extra stuff in the meta tag? These are all goood questions. Let's explore.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first line is not an HTML tag. Rather, this line is a statemet to the browser
				identifying the type of document. The most recent version of HTML is 5 and the
				doctype value is simple html. The doctype values are much wordier in earlier versions
				of HTML. There is also a variant XHTML type of HTML. XHTML is not in the itenerary 
				for this tour, and we will only be exploring the current version. Just be aware
				you may see older HTML in your future travels, and some things you may do 
				differently in today's HTML than in older HTML.
			</p>
			<p>
				Next up is the html tag. The starting tag is on the second line. The ending tag is
				on the last line. The difference between the two tags is the forward slash in the
				ending tag just before the tag name of HTML. You may wonder why we have to declare
				a HTML tag. After all, we are creating a HTML document. Well, we can also include
				JavaScript in our HTML and we mark the JavaScript part of the file with a 
				&lt;script&gt; tag. We will explore JavaScript in a future segment of our tour. 
				For now, all we need to know is we need to put our HTML code inside of 
				&lt;html&gt; tags.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first thing to appear inside the &lt;html&gt; tag is the &lt;head&gt; tag. This 
				section allows us to describe the web page. We still have not got to a point where
				we would code what we see on a web page, but we are getting there.
			</p>
			<p>
				The &lt;meta&gt; tag is the firt stop in the &lt;head&gt; tag. Meta offers 
				descriptions about web page. There can be multiple &lt;meta&gt; tags each of
				which provide a different type of information. The example here includes an 
				attribute called charset and we set the value to utf-8. 
			</p>
			<p>The charset states the character set in use for the web page. The character set 
				assigns a number to each character or symbol you see on screen. There are a 
				few different character sets including the familiar 
				<abbr title="American Standard Code for Information Interchange">ASCII</abbr>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Every html element (tag) can have an attribute. Attributes provide additional
				information about the element. There are some attributes common to all
				elements, and other attributes specific to other elements. In all cases, 
				we provide the attribute name and set it equal to a value in quotes. We will
				explore more attributes as we continue our tour.
			</p>
			<p>
				The title element provides a title for the web page. Hover over the tab for this 
				page in your browser. You will see the text "A Learning Journey in Software
				Development." You will also see this same text if you hover over the icon
				for your browser. This value appears because it is the title value in the
				HTML for this web page.
			</p>
			<p>
				Finally, we arrive at the body element. The body is where we insert the HTML
				code to display on the web page and which will be visible when you view it.
				Note there is nothing inside the body tags. What do you think will appear
				if we view this code in a browser? If you guessed nothing, you are correct.
				You will see a blank screen because we have not said what to show. Try it out.
			</p>
			<p>
				Type the code in Code 1 into your text editor and save the file using the name
				basic.html in a folder. If you do not want to type the code yourself,
				feel free to download it from 
				<a href="https://github.com/johnelomas/johnelomas_examples" target="_blank">
					my GitHub repository
				</a>. 
				It is important for the file name to have a html
				extension. So, make sure your file name ends in html. Go to the folder
				containing basic.html and double-click the file. The file should launch
				in your web browser.
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-center">Next Stop, Hello World</h3>
			<p>
				The obligatory first stop in a tour of any new language is getting 
				it to say "Hello World" to you. This small milestone means you have
				everything set up correctly.
			</p>
			<p>
				Remember that I said the page contents go in the body element. Start by
				making a copy of our previous basic.html file and save the file with 
				hello.html as the file name. Between the start and end tags of the body
				element, enter Hello World and save the file. You can change the title
				if you want, but the change is not necessary. If you do not want to type 
				code yourself, feel free to download it from 
				<a href="https://github.com/johnelomas/johnelomas_examples" target="_blank">
					my GitHub repository
				</a>. Code 2 shows the change.
				Now, open the file in your browser. If your browser view looks like 
				Figure 1, then you have succeeded in creating your first web page.
			</p>
			<figure class="figure">
				<pre class="border border-primary rounded-lg"><code>
	&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

			<h3 class="text-center">Let's See Some Common HTML Tags</h3>
			<p>
				Code 3 shows some commonly used tags. Figure 2 shows how this code 
				appears in a browser.
			</p>
			<figure class="figure">
				<pre class="border border-primary rounded-lg"><code>
	&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
	&lt;html&gt;
		&lt;head&gt;

			&lt;title&gt;Common HTML Tags&lt;/title&gt;
		&lt;/head&gt;
		&lt;body&gt;
			&lt;!-- Here is a comment. --&gt;
			&lt;div&gt;
				&lt;h1&gt;h1 tag: Header 1&lt;/h1&gt;
				&lt;h2&gt;h2 tag: Header 2&lt;/h2&gt;
				&lt;h3&gt;h3 tag: Header 3&lt;/h3&gt;
				&lt;h4&gt;h4 tag: Header 4&lt;/h4&gt;
				&lt;h5&gt;h5 tag: Header 5&lt;/h5&gt;
				&lt;h6&gt;h6 tag: Header 6&lt;/h6&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;div&gt;
				&lt;p&gt;
					Paragraphs group related sentences. Use the p tag for sentences.
				&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;div&gt;
				This anchor tag (a) will &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/"&gt;take me to Google.&lt;/a&gt;	
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;div&gt;
				&lt;div&gt;The img tag is good for showing images like this brown rectangle.&lt;/div&gt;
				&lt;img src="./brownrect.png" alt="brown rectangle"&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;		
			&lt;div&gt;	
				Unordered List uses the ul tag with the li tag. 
				&lt;ul&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;An unordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Another unordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Yet another unordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ul&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;
			&lt;div&gt;
				Ordered List uses the ol tag with the li tag.
				&lt;ol&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;An ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Another ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
					&lt;li&gt;Yet another ordered list item&lt;/li&gt;
				&lt;/ol&gt;
			&lt;/div&gt;		
		&lt;/body&gt;
	&lt;/html&gt;

			<p>
				All the exciting stuff happens within the body element. Despite this statement,
				the very first thing we encounter within the body tags in Code 3 is not 
				that exciting at all, at least from a visual perspective. 				
			</p>
			<p>
				The first item is a comment. Comments are important to remind yourself and to
				tell others infomation about the code and explain why you did something
				the way you did. The comments are only visible in the HTML code and never
				appear on screen. Although comments are not necessary, they are helpful.
				All comments start with and &lt;!-- tag and end with a --> tag. The format
				is different than other tags we have seen, and, yes, we do need both dashes
				at the start and end. Your actual comments go in the middle. Comments can 
				run for mutiple lines. Just put the start tag where your comments begin 
				and the end tag where your comments end. You could use the comment tags
				to comment out HTML code as well. Maybe you have some HTML which you want
				to keep in the file, but not show right now. Place comment tags around the
				HTML and the browser will ignore the code until you remove the comment tags.
			</p>
			<p>
				As we look further down the code, we see several div elements. These div 
				elements are divisions, or sections, where we can group related things together.
				Again, the div element is non-visual. You might want to have a div element
				to contain fields to show address information, or another to contain a list
				of places where you have worked and thier locations.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first div element we see contains six header tags noted by h1, h2, h3,
				h4, h5, h6. There are only six header tags. Header tags are an example of where
				the tag has a noticeable effect on what we see. The h1 tag, like the masthead
				on a newspaper, is the biggest. The h6 tag is the smallest. The bigger the 
				header, the more prevalence is related to the information within it. Keep this
				fact in mind as search engines will rate the information near a h1 tag as more 
				important than informaton in a h2 tag, and so on down to the h6 tag.
			</p>
			<p>
				We enounter the p tag next. Think of the p tag as a paragraph. We can include 
				paragraphs and text within the p element.
			</p>
			<p>
				The anchor tag is next. Here we use a for anchor. The anchor tag contains
				a href attribute. This attribute only applies to a select few tags. The href
				attribute puts the hyper in HyperText Markup Language by serving as a launching
				point to go to another web page or document. The text between the starting and
				ending tag also has special formatting to indicate it is a link: different 
				color for the different text, underlined text, text color change if you have
				not clicked a link or if you have clicked the link. In our example, cliking 
				anywhere on the "take me to Google" text will load the Google home page
				into the browser. Changing the value of the href attribute changes where
				you will go. Try subsituting other web site address to experiment.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our next div element bring us to the img tag. There are a couple of special 
				notes here. First, notice there is a starting img (for image) tag but no
				ending tag. I did not make a mistake. The img tag does not have an ending
				tag. We could include one, but it is necessary and might even present
				a problem in some browsers if you do. The basic reason for no ending tag is
				that the img tag shows only images, no text. Since there is no text, there 
				is no reason to indicate where text will end.
			</p>
			<p>
				The next thing to notice about the img tag is the src (for source) attribute.
				This attribute says what the sourc of the image is. In other words, the src
				is where would the page find the image file. In our example, we can find the
				image at "./brownrect.png". The ./ means the image is in the same folder as
				our HTML file. The remainder is the name of the file. We are using an image
				of type file type png here, but we could use other image types as well including:
				gif and jpeg file types.
			</p>
			<p>
				The final thing to notice about our img tag is the alt (for alternate) 
				attribute. This attribute contains a short description of the image. This
				alternative text shows if the image file was missing or was unavailable to 
				the browser, a small x would appear on the screen. The value of the alt 
				attribute would appear next to the x and explain what the user would normally 
				see there. Some text explanation is better than a wierd x symbol appearing. 
				Also, the value of the alt attribute is helpful to visually impaired users who visit your web page. These users could be using the screen reader accessibility tool and this tool will use the alt value to tell your visitor what is there.
			</p>
			<p>
				The final two div elements contain lists: an uordered list (ul tag), and an
				ordered list (ol tag). Both lists contain list items (li tag). The default
				marker for each list item in an unordered list is a black bullet. The default
				marker for each list item in an unordered list is a number starting with 1. 
				There are attributes to change these default values, but we can explore
				these options at another time.
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-center">See HTML Tags With Meaning</h3>
			<p>
				One of the goals of HTML5 is to make web pages more semantic, or, more 
				simply, more meaningful. The visitor to your web page may not notice or care, 
				but more meaningful tags will help the internet be easier to rate 
				information on a page and to find related information across the entire web. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Think of a daily newspaper. There is the front page main banner at the top of
				the page. There is an index of where to find certain topics such as weather, 
				comics, obituaries, letters to the editor, and more. There are several articles.
				Some articles may have some ancillary information like a short biography 
				of the reporter, or information about the article's topic which provides
				background about the subject not necessarily related to the main topic of 
				the article. At the bottom of the page, there may be a copyright and 
				information about the newspaper publisher. Some of these items would repeat
				for each section (national news, local news, sports, living) of the paper.
			</p>
			<p>
				Using the markup we have visited so far, we would probably create a div element for the banner, another for index, a div for each article, ancillary information, and publisher. We might even nest the div elements where there would be a div
				element for each section of the paper. This technique would not really give 
				a good understanding of how these div elements relate to one another, and 
				would be difficult to find what is important to you. HTML5 introduces some new 
				tags to help with organize these relationships.
			</p>
			<figure class="figure">
				<img class=" border border-primary rounded-lg" src="./images/html5.png" alt="HTML5 tag example">
				<figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">Figure 3: Some HTML5 tags.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				Figure 3 shows the relationship between some of the new tags in HTML5.
				This example could be a prototype of Page One of our previous newspaper.
				The header tag would be the banner, or mast head. The nav (for navigation)
				would be the index. Each article would be nested in an article element. The
				ancillary information (reporter bio, related article information, ...) 
				would be in the aside element which could be in the article element. The
				publisher information could go in the footer element. This whole page 
				might go in a section element (not shown). We could have section elements
				for the national news section, local news section, sports section, and so on.
				Each of these section elements would contain article elements for each
				article in the section. As you can see, these tags describe the
				relationship between each other better than using div and p tags.
			</p>
			<h3 class="text-center">What Next?</h3>
			<p>
				We have seen a lot in this tour and experienced a good general feel
				of building a web page. There is more to explore which builds on 
				what we have seen so far.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="https://htmlreference.io/">HTML Reference</a> lists all
					HTML tags and how to use them. Each tag lists applicable attributes,
					and gives examples of use.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp">W3 Schools</a> 
					lists HTML tags. A benefit here is the Try It functionality which
					lets you modify the examples and see the result of the change.
