								This tour builds on what we saw during our tours of <a href="./html.html">HTML</a> and <a href="./css.html">CSS</a>. Be sure to revisit these tours before continuing here. Our tour of HTML showed examples of unstyled web pages, and the CSS tour showed how to make web pages more attractive. In this tour, we learn how a web page can change in content, style, and behavior based on user interaction.
							</p>

								JavaScript originated at Netscape to add dynamic behavior to web pages. Later, Netscape submitted JavaScript to <a href="https://www.ecma-international.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">ECMA</a> to maintain the standards of the language. ECMA has ECMAScript as a root language. TypeScript and JavaScript are both child languages of ECMAScript which means neither can do anything which does not exist in ECMAScript. Not all features which exist in ECMAScript must exist in either TypeScript or JavaScript. TypeScript is a compiled language and can compile into JavaScript whereas JavaScript is an interpreted language. Modern web browsers contain a JavaScript interpreter which means we can execute the same JavaScript code in these browsers running in any operating system. This broad presence of the interpreter makes JavaScript a good language for creating dynamic web sites.

								There are only two things we need before starting: a text editor to create a web page and a web browser to view it. A good free text editor is Notepad++. A popular browser is Google Chrome. I will be using both tools for our tour, but feel free to use your own favorite tools. 
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Notepad++:</em> You can download the proper version for your device at the 
								<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Download page</a>. 
								Just run the setup program accepting all the defaults.
							</p>
							<p>
								<em>Chrome:</em> Click "Download Chrome" on the 
								<a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIgbecvN7b5AIV0MDACh0DpAQWEAAYASABEgJT6PD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">
								Download page</a> to automatically download and install.
							</p>
							<p>
								This tour will show code examples. These examples have a caption like: Code 1 with some descriptive text and a file name in parentheses. You can copy the examples from this web page and paste into a new file in your text editor, type the same code yourself into your text editor as it appears in the examples, or copy the indicated files in the captions from <a href="https://github.com/johnelomas/johnelomas_examples/tree/master/WebFundamentals/CSS">My Code Examples Code Repository.</a> Feel free to use any method. It is important for the file name to have a html extension. So, make sure your file name ends in html. Go to your folder containing the html file and double-click the file. The file should launch in your web browser.
							</p>
							<p>
								We can also run JavaScript code within the browser itself. Clicking the <kbd>F12</kbd> key will launch the Developer Tools for the browser. This command works across a variety of browsers including Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome, Firefox, and others. The developer tools allow you to see the HTML design of the page, related source files for the page, network traffic. Among these tools will be a Console tab where you can enter and run JavaScript commands. These commands only work for the browser session and will disappear when you close the Developer Tools. You still need to save your JavaScript code in a file if you want to use it again. We will explore the Console tool more during our tour.

								Every language has a syntax which describes how to arrange characters into words into meaningful phrases. The syntax of many computer languages can be similar, but there are distinctions among them. There are a few basic commonalities among them all. These items are:
							</p>
							<ol>
								<li>Declaring a variable</li>
								<li>Assigning a value to the variable</li>
								<li>Testing the value of the variable</li>
								<li>Looping through a range of values for the variable</li>
							</ol>
							<p>
								Think about signing for a world cruise. Before you can buy your ticket, you sign into your cruise account by providing your name and password on the cruise company's website. The cruise company needs to collect this information to check their list of all names and passwords to see if you provided a valid combination of name and password. Behind the scenes, the website creates a variable for name and another for password, assigns the name the user provided to a name variable and the password to a password variable, then loops through each user in the users lists to test if there is a user with the name stored in the name variable with a password stored in the name variable. If there is a match, the website allows the user access to the site or denies access if there is not a match and may even tell the user what was wrong. In this short example, we have seen all four basic commonalities: declare a variable, give the variable a value, loop through a range of values, and test the variable. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Now that we have described a real world scenario, the question is how can we do all these things with JavaScript. Let's start with declaring variables and assigning values to variables. There are three keywords for declaring a variable: var, let, and const (short for constant). The keyword var is the one we will see most often because let and const are recent additions to JavaScript after ECMAScript introduced them in version 6. For now, we will look at var.
							</p>
							<p>
								JavaScript is a weakly typed language which means variables can hold different types of data. Some languages only allow a variable to hold certain types of data. JavaScript infers the data type based on how we assign values to the variable. Data types in JavaScript are number, string, Boolean, object, function, and undefined.
							</p>
							<p>
								I am going to give a brief description of each data type and follow up with examples later. Numbers are just what you would expect--any whole number or decimal number. Strings are any text--any combination of letters, punctuation, and numbers. Booleans are true and false values. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Objects are like a combination of variables referring to the same thing. Think of a person. A person has a name and an age. Say person A is Sally and person A's age is 20, and person B is Jack and person B's age is 21. Each person is an object. Sally is one object and Jack is another. Both Jack and Sally objects have common characteristics (name and age) which may have different values. 
							</p>
							<p>
								A function is a collection of JavaScript statements. A statement is a single instruction. Each statement needs to end with a semi-colon (;) character. JavaScript does not force us to use the ending character for each statement and will automatically add it if you don't provide it. However, you run the risk JavaScript may add the ending character in an expected place. Best practice is to always use it. Functions are parts of code which we expect to use multiple times, but we only want to write once. A simplistic function would be one called Add which takes two number variables as input and returns the sum of the two numbers.
							</p>
							<p>
								Undefined is a little bit different than then other data types as it does not actually represent a variable's value. Rather undefined refers to a variable which does not have a value. If we declare a variable but do not assign it a value, the variable is undefined.
							</p>
							<p>
								Let's look at variables using our web browser's console window. As I mentioned earlier, I am showing examples using Chrome. I can access Developer Tools by pressing my <kbd>F12</kbd> key. This short cut works on most browsers. If you have trouble finding it, look in your browser's menu for an item like "More Tools" with a sub-item like "Developer Tools" and click that item. Once Developer Tools are available, there will be tabs for several tools. Click on the tab for Console. The Console lets us enter JavaScript code and see the results.
							</p>
							<p>
								We can enter each statement from Code 1 into the Console window. The results of entering each of these statements is in Figure 1.
							</p>
							<figure class="img-fluid figure">
							<pre class="border border-primary rounded-lg"><code>
	var age = 25;			// data type is number	
	
	var cost = 1.49;		// data type is number	

	var name = 'Jack';		// data type is string	

	var name = "Jack";		// data type is string	

	var age = '25';			// data type is string	

	var isMinor = false;	        // data type is boolean	

	isMinor = true;			// data type is Boolean	

	var x;				// data type is undefined	

	var personA = {			// data type is object	
			name: 'Jack',
			age: 25
		      };
		
	function add(x, y) {		// data type is function	
		var sum = x + y;
		return sum;
	}
	
	/* Function add requires two number values as input.
	   Function add returns the sum of the two number inputs.
	*/	
							</code></pre>

								<img class="img-fluid border border-primary rounded-lg"

								<figcaption class="figure-caption text-left">Figure 1: Results of entering statements from Code 1 into Console window.</figcaption>
							</figure>
							<p>
								The first thing we notice in Code 1 is how we declare a variable and assign it a value. We use the var keyword along with a unique variable name to declare the variable. We assign a value to the variable by including the equals (=) character and supplying the value and including the semi-colon (;) statement ending character to signify we are done writing the statement. The first two entries declare variables age and cost; the age variable holds a whole number (integer) value of 25, and the cost variable holds a decimal value of 1.48. Next to each statement in Code 1, there is a line of text which identifies the data type of the variable on that line. This text begins with 2 forward slashes (//). The slashes denote a comment. JavaScript does not execute code in a statement. Comments are helpful to include descriptions of what is happening in the code. Also, if we look at Figure 1, then we will see the Console writes undefined  on each line after we enter a statement. We can disregard this behavior for now as it is not relevant to what we are exploring.
							</p>
							<p>
								The next 3 entries declare variables name and age. We first declare the variable name and assign the value Jack with single-quotation marks. Next we redeclare the variable name and assign it the value Jack with double-quotation marks. The use of either single or double quotation marks indicates the data type is a string. We can use either form of declaring a string variable value. However, if our string contains an apostrophe (similar to a single quotation mark, then it will be necessary to declare the variable's value with double-quotation marks so JavaScript. For example, if our value was O'Brien and we assigned the value using single-quotation marks, JavaScript will become confused and declare a syntax error because it does not know how to handle the third single-quotation mark. Also notice that we redeclared the variable age and assigned the value 25 in double-quotation marks. Even though we know 25 is a number, JavaScript thinks it is a string because we enclosed it in quotation marks.
